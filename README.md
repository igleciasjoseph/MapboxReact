# Quick Mapbox Introduction

This project was an introduction to Mapbox. I am currently using dummy data since this is not a fully blown out project but rather a quick introduction.

### Running Locally

Mapbox API Token: To run this locally you will need to create a file called `.env.local` and in it put an environment variable called `REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN` that has as its value a token created on the Mapbox website.

### Use `npm install` for the necessary dependencies
